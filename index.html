      <h2> Intro </h2>
      <p>
The Honeymooners, The Cosby Show, and Ellen are classic shows but they shape our society. These shows would affect our views on race, sexuality, and gender roles which has a huge impact on our society. Black-ish has major differences and shows how our society views important topics.

      <h2> The Cosby Show: Race </h2>
      <p>
        	In the Cosby show, you could see how they act very formally, and they use formal language. The family lives in a wealthy neighborhood with a seven hundred thousand dollar house which is now estimated to be five to seven million dollars in the present. Also, the kids in the show would go to ivy league schools and become doctors or lawyers. The main plot of this sitcom was about Mrs. Huxtable trying to buy her grandfather’s painting, therefore showing that her family was artistic and well educated.

      <h2> Black-ish: Race </h2>
      <p>
        The setting in Black-ish is similar to The Cosby Show, where the characters are living in a wealthy neighborhood and own nice houses. Dre’s children go to a private school and then later on they would go to a well-known college. Their language is not formal and the way they act isn’t formal. In addition, the kids would make a mess in the house whereas the kids on The Cosby Show would just make fun of each other. But Dre and his parents use AAVE (African-American Vernacular English) because he was raised in a black neighborhood and Dre tries to teach them about Black culture in America so they could appreciate their culture and what they have rather than Rainbow Johnson beings raised by a white man.

      <h2> The Honeymooners: Gender Norms </h2>
      <p>
        From a feminist lens, The Honeymooners reveals how society views the “American Dream” for the wife to be at home doing all the housework such as cooking, cleaning, and organizing. While the husband would be at work all-day supporting the household. Furthermore, when the husband and wife argue, the husband threatens to “send her to the moon” and the audience would find this abusive threat funny. Then the neighbor next door is an allusion to what society would look like if it didn’t follow gender norms such as having to work all night and rest all day which gave the men in the cast a bad reaction to it.

      <h2> Black-ish: Gender Norms </h2>
      <p>
        	The difference between The Honeymooners and Black-ish is the husband and the wife have jobs. The husbands both have jobs, one of them is a bus driver and the other, Dre Johnson, is an advertising executive. Whereas the wives, the sitcom in the cast displays one as a stay-at-home mom doing the chores but the wife Rainbow Johnson is an anesthesiologist who is the primary income earner in their household. Although the mom in the current show has a job, she still has to fulfill her duty as a mom and do all the household chores and take care of the kids.

      <h2> Three’s Company: Queer </h2>
      <p>
        In this example, it shows how they think sexuality outside of heterosexuality is not essential and not taken seriously. In Three’s Company, two girls found a man in their bathtub after a party and figured out he’ll be a great fit for their apartment. But the landlords didn’t allow the man to live with the two girls because he imagined the inappropriate acts they would do. Then, one of the girls came up with the idea of saying that he’s gay and the landlord was completely fine with it. This shows how society views the LGBTQ community using it as an excuse or a tool to help them gain a goal.

      <h2> Black-ish: Queer </h2>
      <p>
        A queer analysis from Zoey and her friend asking to go to the bathroom displays how society depicts the LGBTQ community by making it seem like it’s all made up and crazy. Furthermore, it shows how they view people’s identities and expressions as weird and lame, while Zoey and her friend think they’re too cool to be associating with people like that. Viewers of the show will see that LGBTQ is just a complicated topic that shouldn’t be taken seriously and this will damage the LGBTQ community.

      <h2 class = "test"> Conclusion </h2>
      <p>
        Current streaming shows such as Black-ish have improved views in our society such as   Rainbow being the primary income earner because typically in society, men would be the primary income earner in the household. Even though they made improvements, they still need to improve on their views on sexuality and gender. Rainbow is the primary income earner of the household, but she still takes care of the household and Zoey thinks talking about your sexuality isn’t important. Although television shows and sitcoms have seen many improvements regarding sexuality and gender, they still have a long way to go.
